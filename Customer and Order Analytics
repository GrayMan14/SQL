#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-Which product that was sold in January was the cheapest price?- 

 SELECT 
     J.Product,
     J.price 
         FROM BIT_DB.JanSales AS J 
             ORDER BY J.price
                 LIMIT 1;
     
-What was the total revenue for all products sold in January?-
